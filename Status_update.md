# MNIST Neural Network Classifier

I've finished my minimum viable product, which was understanding and implementing the neural network for the MNIST data.
This implementation provides a way to check the accuracy of the neural network (96 percent with the correct hyperparameters)
This involved a large amount of research and understanding, however, my goal is to further it through implementing a facility for user input. This is proving to be difficult because a correctly sized image needs to be converted to a correctly sized numpy array, added to a nested data structure which I haven't figured out, and then run through an already saved network. I've completed some of these steps but haven't fully figured out how to add the array properly to an already existing unzipped testing data set.

UPDATE: The classifier classifies an inputted number now with a very low success rate, so I am going to continue to work on optimizing the code. I'm going to implement saving and loading a network to test my code.
